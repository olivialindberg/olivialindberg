# Welcome to my website!

I am Olivia Lindberg, a student in the Epidemiology and Biostatistics PhD program at Case Western Reserve University. The program is within the Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences in the School of Medicine. I graduated from Penn State University in 2024 (We are!) with my B.S. in Biostatistics. I love numbers and working with health data!

On this website, you'll find in depth information about my research experiences as well as my interests and goals. Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:mail.oxl77@case.edu) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects.
