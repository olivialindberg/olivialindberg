Through my self-portraits, I aim to capture the essence of my own being and reflect on my own journey through time. Each photograph is a reflection of my own experiences and emotions. Through my photography, I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a scholar and adventurer, and inspire others to reflect on their own journeys through the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

    "text": "arXiv Preprint | Code\nOver the centuries, I have devoted countless hours to deciphering and translating the ancient scripts and dialects of the various peoples of Middle-earth. My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

    "text": "In one of my courses this semester, we’re reading a book called “How To Be A Modern Scientist” by Jeff Leek. One really useful chapter was about scientific blogging, which is something I don’t think about too often. Blogging seems like it’s been left behind with the rise of LinkedIn and X as professional and scientific communication platforms. However, Leek highlights the importance of maintaining a scientific blog, along with many other practices that are beneficial as a scientist. Especially being early in my career (first-year into my PhD) I really appreciate how Leek explained the value of exposure and connection by blogging. I’m hopeful to make many connections in my field, and starting a blog could be a good way to get more connected to the greater biostats community. Also, for personal use, I think it would be nice to have blog posts to look back on later in my career. It’s cool that I’m still at the start of my journey in biostats, and I’m sure this will be an interesting time to look back on. Also, blogging could be especially useful to document my struggles and hurdles in completing my thesis. I’m not sure if anyone will end up reading this but I think there’s enough good reason to start a blog regardless of potential audience or exposure.\nTo set the stage, I’m currently in my second semester of my first year at CWRU. It’s been a very busy, exhausting, and overwhelming year, but I’m so grateful to be here. It feels like all of my hard work in high school and undergrad is finally paying off with real progress towards my goals. During my most challenging days, I always remind myself how lucky I am to be here. Education is a privilege, especially now more than ever, and being a grad student is one of the coolest jobs. I get to learn and grow and explore my interests. It’s also an excuse to not be a real adult with a 9-5 for a few more years."
